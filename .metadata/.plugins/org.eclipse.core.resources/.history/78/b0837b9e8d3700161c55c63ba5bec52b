Sudoku is a single-player mind game. "The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits 1 to 9, so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "sub-squares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a unique solution."
